# Project React Native App ðŸ“±

I made a mobile app with React Native, you shake your phone and get random images fetched from an api.

## The problem

I had alot of issues with the expo app, I could'nt get it to show on my phone.
The problems I had i got alot of help from stackoverflow and from my classmates, im acctually really proud of one problem that I managed to solve. I wanted the api I worked with to show random images so I had to create a function that randomly picked the id's for the images wich I then called for in the fetch.
